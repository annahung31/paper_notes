## Dataset used in this paper

- Private dataset
    - Brief info: 284 professionally transcribed solos of (mostly) Bebop saxophone players of the early 20th century. The solos were purchased from SaxSolos.com [36]; we are thus unable to publish them. 

## Model Architecture
* LSTM
* transformer-XL

## Experiments
* harmonic coherence metrics (matric learning)
